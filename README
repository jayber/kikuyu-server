kikuyu
======

Kikuyu is the composition and delivery application for functional components (i.e. components that define all their
layers with the component, might be called vertical components after vertical slice.). These are distinct from components
that only cover a single layer of architecture - horizontal components, may be service components as parts of a
"wedding cake" architecture.

Installation:
#############

Install Play Framework on you machine:
http://www.playframework.com/

Install sbt on your machine:
http://www.scala-sbt.org/

You might need to set your proxy in your system environment variables:

http_proxy=http://cache2.practicallaw.com:8080

however this will mean any WS request to the localhost address will also attempt to go via the proxy and therefore fail.
i tried this:

no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1

it didn't work!
I had to remove the http_proxy env var to get it to work.

Now, whenever I run a play or sbt command that needs to resolve dependencies, such as 'clean', i run

set http_proxy=http://cache2.practicallaw.com:8080

in the console window and then run the play or sbt command in the same window. This setting therefore doesn't persist
between command windows.

You can probably get something better going using JVM proxy arguments (e.g. -Dhttp_proxy ?)

Install the Play 2.0 Plugin (this is not just the ordinary Play plugin, you need to search for it by connecting to the
IntelliJ plugin repository)

IntelliJ Dependencies
#####################

If you add or change dependencies in your Build.scala IntelliJ probably won't pick them up.

You should go to a command window in your project directory and run:

play "idea with-sources=yes"

which will update your IntelliJ project.
